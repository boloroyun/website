# MongoDB Connection Fix Instructions

I've updated your application to better handle MongoDB connection issues. Here's what I've done and how to test the changes:

## Changes Made

1. Created a new MongoDB connection helper at `lib/mongodb.ts` with:
   - Connection retry logic
   - Better error handling
   - Proper resource management

2. Updated these server action files to use the new connection helper:
   - `actions/categories.actions.ts`
   - `actions/topbar.actions.ts`
   - `actions/navigation.actions.ts`

3. Created a MongoDB connection test script at `scripts/test-mongodb.js`

## How to Fix the Connection Issue

1. **Update Your MongoDB Connection String in .env file**

   Edit your `.env` file and update the MongoDB connection string:

   ```
   DATABASE_URL="mongodb+srv://Boogii333888:Boss20252026@cluster0.wkqtz.mongodb.net/myapp?retryWrites=true&w=majority&authSource=admin&directConnection=true"
   ```

   Key changes:
   - Added `directConnection=true` - Forces a direct connection
   - Added `authSource=admin` - Specifies the authentication database

2. **Test Your MongoDB Connection**

   Run the test script to verify the connection:

   ```bash
   node scripts/test-mongodb.js
   ```

   If successful, you'll see "âœ… Successfully connected to MongoDB!"
   If it fails, the script will provide diagnostics to help troubleshoot.

3. **Verify MongoDB Atlas Configuration**
   - Log into your MongoDB Atlas account
   - Make sure your IP address is whitelisted in Network Access
   - Check if your cluster is active and has no issues
   - If using a free tier, consider upgrading for better reliability

4. **Restart Your Next.js Application**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **If Issues Persist**

   Try one of these solutions:
   - Regenerate your Prisma client:
     ```
     npx prisma generate
     ```
   - Try a different network connection (sometimes networks block MongoDB ports)
   - Create a new MongoDB Atlas cluster if this one is problematic

## Understanding the Error

The error you were seeing:

```
Server selection timeout: None of the available servers suitable for criteria ReadPreference(Primary)
```

This typically means:

1. Your MongoDB Atlas cluster can't be reached
2. You don't have permission to connect
3. There's a network issue blocking the connection
4. The primary server in your replica set is down

The changes we made should help in most cases, but if it's a MongoDB Atlas service issue, you may need to wait for it to be resolved or contact MongoDB support.
