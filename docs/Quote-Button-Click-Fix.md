# Get a Quote Now Button Click Fix

## Problem

The "Get a Quote Now" button on individual product pages was not clickable. Users were unable to interact with the button to open the quote request modal.

## Root Causes

1. **Component Rendering Issue**:
   - The button was being rendered properly but event handlers were not being triggered
   - The shadcn/ui Button component was not properly handling click events in this specific context
   - Possible z-index issues causing the button to be visually present but not receiving click events

2. **Event Propagation**:
   - Click events might have been intercepted or blocked by parent elements
   - Event bubbling issues preventing the click from reaching the button's handler

## Solution

### 1. Button Component Replacement

- Replaced the shadcn/ui `Button` component with a native HTML `button` element
- Added explicit event handling with `preventDefault()` and `stopPropagation()`
- Added debugging to track click events

```tsx
// Before
<Button
  onClick={openModal}
  className={`${className} bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded`}
>
  Get a Quote Now
</Button>

// After
<button
  type="button"
  onClick={handleButtonClick}
  className={`${className} bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white py-2 px-4 rounded font-medium cursor-pointer`}
>
  Get a Quote Now
</button>
```

### 2. Z-index Improvements

- Added a wrapper div with `relative z-10` to ensure the button is in front of other elements
- This ensures the button receives click events properly

```tsx
<div className="relative z-10">
  <GetQuoteButton
    productData={{
      id: productData.id,
      title: productData.title,
      sku: productData?.slug || '',
    }}
    className="w-full"
  />
</div>
```

### 3. Event Handling Enhancement

- Added a dedicated click handler function with proper event management
- Implemented console logging to help with debugging

```tsx
const handleButtonClick = (e: React.MouseEvent) => {
  console.log('Quote button clicked!');
  e.preventDefault(); // Prevent any default behavior
  e.stopPropagation(); // Stop event propagation
  openModal();
};
```

## Testing

Created a test script (`scripts/test-quote-button-click.js`) using Puppeteer to verify:

1. The button is visible on the product page
2. The button is clickable
3. The quote modal appears when the button is clicked

The test confirms that the button is now working correctly.

## Affected Files

1. `components/product/GetQuoteButton.tsx` - Main fix for the button component
2. `components/product/ProductActions.tsx` - Added z-index wrapper for better click handling

## Future Improvements

1. Consider adding more robust event handling throughout the application
2. Implement automated testing for critical UI interactions
3. Add visual indicators (like hover effects) to improve user feedback
