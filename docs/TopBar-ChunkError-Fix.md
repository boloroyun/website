# TopBarWrapperClient Chunk Loading Error Fix

## Problem

The application was experiencing a chunk loading error when trying to load the TopBarWrapperClient component:

```
Unhandled Runtime Error

ChunkLoadError: Loading chunk _app-pages-browser_components_TopBarWrapperClient_tsx failed.
(error: http://localhost:3000/_next/static/chunks/_app-pages-browser_components_TopBarWrapperClient_tsx.js)
```

This error occurred because of issues with the dynamic import of the TopBarWrapperClient component and how it was handling data fetching.

## Root Cause

1. The original implementation used `dynamic(() => import('./TopBarWrapperClient'))` with `ssr: false`, which can sometimes cause chunk loading errors in Next.js, especially when the imported component is complex.

2. The TopBarWrapperClient component was trying to fetch data from two different API endpoints in a single useEffect hook, which can lead to race conditions and potential errors during hydration.

3. The component was too large and doing too many things at once (fetching data, processing it, and rendering multiple components), making it more prone to loading issues.

## Solution

### 1. Split the Component into Smaller Pieces

We refactored the code to follow a more modular approach:

1. Created separate client components for each part of the functionality:
   - `ClientTopBar.tsx` - Handles fetching and displaying topbars
   - `ClientCategoriesTopBar.tsx` - Handles fetching and displaying categories

2. Simplified the main `TopBarWrapperClient.tsx` to just compose these components:

```tsx
'use client';

import React from 'react';
import { ClientTopBar } from './client/ClientTopBar';
import { ClientCategoriesTopBar } from './client/ClientCategoriesTopBar';

// Simplified client component version of TopBarWrapper
export default function TopBarWrapperClient() {
  return (
    <div className="w-full">
      <ClientTopBar />
      <ClientCategoriesTopBar />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### 2. Removed Dynamic Import

Instead of using dynamic import with `ssr: false`, we now import the client component directly:

```tsx
// Import the client component directly
import TopBarWrapperClient from './TopBarWrapperClient';

const DefaultHeader = () => {
  return (
    <header>
      <TopBarWrapperClient />
      <Navbar />
    </header>
  );
};
```

This approach is simpler and less prone to chunk loading errors.

### 3. Isolated Data Fetching

Each client component now handles its own data fetching independently:

- `ClientTopBar` fetches only topbar data
- `ClientCategoriesTopBar` fetches only navigation data

This separation helps prevent race conditions and makes the code more maintainable.

## Benefits

1. **Better Error Isolation**: If one component fails to load or fetch data, it won't affect the other components.

2. **Improved Performance**: Smaller chunks are faster to load and less likely to cause timeout issues.

3. **Better Code Organization**: Each component has a single responsibility, making the code easier to maintain.

4. **Enhanced Reliability**: Simpler components with focused responsibilities are less likely to encounter runtime errors.

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. Restart the Next.js development server
2. Navigate to pages that use the DefaultHeader component
3. Check the browser console for any chunk loading errors
4. Verify that both the topbar and categories sections load correctly
