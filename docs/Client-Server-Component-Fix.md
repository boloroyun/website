# Client/Server Component Integration Fix

## Problem

The error message:

```
Warning: async/await is not yet supported in Client Components, only Server Components. This error is often caused by accidentally adding `'use client'` to a module that was originally written for the server.
```

This error occurred because we were trying to use an async Server Component (`TopBarWrapper`) directly within a Client Component (`Template`). In Next.js, you cannot use async Server Components directly inside Client Components.

## Solution

We implemented a solution that follows Next.js best practices for handling this scenario:

1. **Created a client-side version of TopBarWrapper**:
   - Created `TopBarWrapperClient.tsx` that uses React hooks and fetch API to get data
   - Implemented loading states to provide a smooth user experience

2. **Added API routes to fetch the data**:
   - Created `/api/topbars` endpoint to fetch topbar data
   - Created `/api/navigation` endpoint to fetch navigation data
   - These endpoints use the same server actions as the server component

3. **Updated DefaultHeader component**:
   - Marked DefaultHeader as a client component
   - Used dynamic import with `{ ssr: false }` to load the client version of TopBarWrapper
   - Added a loading placeholder for better UX

## Technical Details

### Client Component Data Fetching

When working with Client Components that need data from server actions, follow this pattern:

1. Create API routes that wrap your server actions
2. Use `useEffect` and `fetch` in your client components to call these API routes
3. Implement loading states and error handling

### Component Structure

- **Server Components**: Can use async/await and server actions directly
- **Client Components**: Must use fetch API or SWR/React Query to get data

## Testing

You can test the API routes using the provided script:

```
node scripts/test-api-routes.js
```

## Future Maintenance

When adding new features that require data in client components:

1. Create or update API routes as needed
2. Use the client-side data fetching pattern
3. Avoid mixing async Server Components directly in Client Components
