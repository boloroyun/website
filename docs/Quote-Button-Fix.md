# Get a Quote Button Fix

## Problem

The "Get a Quote" button was not working properly. When users clicked the button, the quote request was not being received by the backend and not stored in the MongoDB database, even though the frontend showed a success message.

## Root Causes

1. **MongoDB Connection Issues**:
   - The database connection logic had no retry mechanism
   - ObjectID format validation was missing for product IDs

2. **API Error Handling**:
   - The quote submission API didn't have proper error handling
   - No retry mechanism for failed database operations

## Solution

### 1. Improved MongoDB Connection

- Added robust connection retry logic in `lib/mongodb.ts`:
  - Implemented `connectWithRetry` function with exponential backoff
  - Added proper error handling and logging
  - Implemented connection pooling for development environment

### 2. Enhanced Quote API Routes

- Updated `/api/quotes/fallback-create/route.ts`:
  - Added ObjectID validation to handle invalid product IDs
  - Used a fallback field (`productReference`) for non-ObjectID format IDs
  - Improved error handling and logging

- Updated `/api/quotes/route.ts`:
  - Added retry mechanism with increasing delay between attempts
  - Added timeout handling for database operations
  - Improved error reporting with detailed error messages

### 3. Testing

- Created a test script (`scripts/test-quote-submission.js`) to verify:
  - Direct database storage via the fallback-create endpoint
  - End-to-end quote submission via the main quotes endpoint
  - Proper handling of MongoDB ObjectIDs

## Verification

The quote submission functionality now works correctly:

1. When a user clicks "Get a Quote Now" on a product, the modal opens correctly
2. After submitting the form, the data is properly stored in the MongoDB database
3. The system handles errors gracefully and provides proper feedback

## Future Improvements

1. Add monitoring for quote submission success/failure rates
2. Implement a queue system for handling high volumes of quote requests
3. Add admin notification system for failed quote submissions that need attention
