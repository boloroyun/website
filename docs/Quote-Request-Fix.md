# Quote Request System Fix

## Problem

Quote requests were being submitted from the frontend and showing a success message, but the data was not being saved to the MongoDB database. This was causing a disconnect between customer expectations (thinking they had submitted a quote) and business operations (not receiving those quotes).

## Root Cause

The issue was in the quote request flow:

1. The `storePendingQuote` function in `lib/quote-fallback.ts` was designed for client-side use only, checking for `typeof window === 'undefined'` and returning early when running on the server.

2. The main quote API endpoint in `app/api/quotes/route.ts` was calling this client-side function directly in a server context, causing it to fail silently.

3. The success message was still showing to users because the API was returning a success response even though the database save had failed.

## Solution

### 1. Fixed the Quote API Endpoint

Modified `app/api/quotes/route.ts` to directly call the fallback-create API instead of using the client-side `storePendingQuote` function:

```typescript
// Record the quote request in our database (always do this first)
// This ensures we have a copy even if external systems fail
// Use fallback-create API directly since storePendingQuote is client-side only
let savedQuote = null;
try {
  const fallbackResponse = await fetch(
    new URL(
      '/api/quotes/fallback-create',
      process.env.NEXTAUTH_URL || 'http://localhost:3000'
    ),
    {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify(requestData),
    }
  );

  if (fallbackResponse.ok) {
    savedQuote = await fallbackResponse.json();
    logger.debug('üìù Quote API: Successfully stored quote in database');
  } else {
    logger.error('üìù Quote API: Failed to store quote in database');
  }
} catch (dbError) {
  logger.error('üìù Quote API: Error storing quote in database:', dbError);
}
```

### 2. Improved MongoDB Connection in Fallback API

Updated `app/api/quotes/fallback-create/route.ts` to use the centralized MongoDB connection from `lib/mongodb.ts`:

```typescript
// Use the centralized MongoDB connection
import { getPrismaClient } from '@/lib/mongodb';

function getPrisma() {
  return getPrismaClient();
}
```

### 3. Created a Test Script

Added a test script at `scripts/test-quote-db.js` to verify the MongoDB connection for quote requests. This script:

- Tests the connection to MongoDB
- Counts existing quote requests
- Creates a test quote request
- Deletes the test quote request

## How to Test

1. Run the test script to verify the MongoDB connection:

```bash
node scripts/test-quote-db.js
```

2. Submit a test quote request from the website and verify it appears in the database:

```bash
# Connect to MongoDB and check the quoteRequest collection
db.quoteRequest.find().sort({createdAt: -1}).limit(5)
```

## Future Improvements

1. Add better error handling and logging for quote request submissions
2. Implement a retry mechanism for failed database operations
3. Create an admin dashboard to view and manage quote requests
4. Set up email notifications for new quote requests
